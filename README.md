# Find The Numbers Game


## Description
_"Find The Numbers"_ is a concentration game. The goal is to find and click numbers, which are displayed in a X by X 
square matrix. The numbers are shuffled. 

If the correct next number is clicked, it disappears from its field.
If the wrong number was clicked, it will be marked in red.
Each game will be timed by a stopwatch.

## Personal Learning Objective
This project was created to exercise Click-Handling and DOM-Manipulation with vanilla JavaScript.
Furthermore it is an introduction to a simple game logic implementation.
The project was made in the first year of my apprenticeship.

## Usage
Simply clone this repository and open the html file in a browser

## How To Play
1. Choose the field size (for the X by X matrix)
   1. e.g.: A field size of 4, will show 16 randomly displayed numbers

   1. Checking the "Hard" checkbox starts a more difficult game mode, 
   2. else it starts in the default game mode. 
3. Click play
4. Have fun!

### Game Modes
* **Default**: Numbers appear in the matrix and stay displayed.
